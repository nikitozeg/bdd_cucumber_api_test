Feature: EPA v2/fees test

  Background:
    And Token service is disconnected
    And Fees is disconnected


  Scenario Outline: Mass payment: Purse --> Card (validate by fullPAN) (single Payment)sdf
    And Token service is connected
    And Token recieved for user bizSanction@qa.swiftcom.uk
    And Fees is connected

    And Add parameters to body request for payment service via "<requestPattern>" pattern by:
      | fromProvider   | fromIdentity   | fromCurrency   | fromAmount   | toProvider   | toCurrency   | toAmount   | details   | externalId |
      | <fromProvider> | <fromIdentity> | <fromCurrency> | <fromAmount> | <toProvider> | <toCurrency> | <toAmount> | <details> | *UUID*     |
    And Add card identity to body request for payment service via "<requestPattern>" pattern by:
      | fullPAN    | cardHolder    |
      | <fullPAN1> | <cardHolder1> |

    * Root object is:
      | state | dateStarted | dateFinished | payments  | id   | self | errorCode       | errorMsgs       |
      | New   | null        | null         | <details> | null | null | <rooterrorCode> | <rooterrorMsgs> |
    * Payment object is:
      | id                                   | to           | from           | externalId | details   | metadata | state   | dateStarted | dateFinished | quote | quoteExpireIn | rate | redirectUrl | errorCode   | errorMsgs   |
      | 00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000 | <toProvider> | <fromProvider> | *UUID*     | <details> | null     | <state> | null        | null         | null  | null          | null | null        | <errorCode> | <errorMsgs> |

    * From object is:
      | provider       | identity       | amount               | currency       | fee  |
      | <fromProvider> | <fromIdentity> | <receivedFromAmount> | <fromCurrency> | null |

    * To object is:
      | provider     | identity           | amount | currency     | fee  |
      | <toProvider> | <receivedIdentity> | null   | <toCurrency> | null |

    And Fees Request is executed
    And Fees results checked



    Examples: check validation for identity=fullPAN:
      | fromProvider | fromIdentity | fromCurrency | fromAmount | --- | toProvider | toCurrency | toAmount | details | fullPAN1   | cardHolder1 | receivedFromAmount | receivedIdentity                      | errorCode | errorMsgs                                                | rooterrorCode | rooterrorMsgs                                                                      | state  | requestPattern |
